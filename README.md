# Final-Project


I am more or less out to create economic agents that will accurately negotiate a price in a marketplace. 

I had the idea to do an interface for menu like we did before. 

Then we would have a game which actually ran the game and presented the frames of the game. 

My first stab at implementation will have buyers and sellers who are agents in a game. Each of these nouns are classes. 

I'm gonna take a stab at implementing them.
